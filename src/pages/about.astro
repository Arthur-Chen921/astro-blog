		I hope I have opportunity to meet you.

		I enjoy playing the piano and saxophone. In the club, I am always an active organizer. 
		I enjoy hosting various board games, brainstorming, or playing games with people from 
		different backgrounds.

		It's hard to say that participating in entrepreneurial activities is a hobby, 
		but I enjoy organizing data and knowledge within a limited amount of time, 
		and thinking about the potential and feasibility of various methods. 
		Understanding things I don't know always excites me, I even once spent a whole 
		night studying quantum physics (obviously I didn't get it).

		I sometimes immerse myself in my own time, reading or creating, 
		or taking a hike with good friends.
