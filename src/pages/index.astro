			<p>
				Hello, traveller, good to have you here. Please give me some time to introduce myself!
			</p>
			<p>
				My past experience is somewhat complex. I have worked as a screenwriter, sold insurance, 
				planned for an advertising company, created computer games, and served as a client manager 
				for world-class freight companies.
				In just two years, the game I participated in the production of went online on Steam, and 
				I co-organized a global writing conference. I won photography and design awards, and I 
				also launched a small entrepreneurial project that successfully promoted the platform 
				to tens of thousands of people. Now, I have the opportunity to chat with many investors 
				from different fields every day. In different jobs, I gradually discovered my 
				lifelong interest: <strong>data</strong> and <strong>analysis</strong>.
