In this section, I will show you how to create an earthquake distribution archive with map coordinates, taking into account Gantt chart, bubble chart, and band chart.
Firstly, I obtained the codes, intensities, and latitude and longitude coordinates of various earthquakes over the past fifty years. But this is still far from our analysis, as latitude and longitude need further conversion to be divided into countries and continents.



I have used these two libraries : 
1) **Reverse Geocoder** 
2) **Pycountry**

Through code below, we can get columns with detailed information of each earthquake:


When executing data entry tasks, the system:
- Logs user operations with audit trails
- Provides intelligent data cleansing with integrity verification to protect critical information
- Processes standardized data through configured formulas
- Cross-references preset thresholds (risk indexes/profit margins) and external data sources
- Triggers real-time alerts to designated managers when hitting cost warnings or KPI targets

The locally-deployed architecture ensures complete control over corporate knowledge assets while maintaining: 
- Automatic synchronization of latest regulations into workflows
- Context-aware data validation against enterprise-specific criteria
- Secure integration with existing on-premise databases

All components support modular replacement, allowing organizations to maintain system evolution aligned with operational needs without infrastructure overhaul.
