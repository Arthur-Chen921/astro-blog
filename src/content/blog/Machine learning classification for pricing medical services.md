The data I selected comes 
from:https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/Pub_ProdResults_Details.jsp?pt=Statist

This study analyzed the impact of medical services on pricing. 
I first clarified my research goal to provide clearer pricing logic for healthcare service 
providers. So I chose decision tree and neural network regression



Because healthcare providers have a significant differentiation in service types and 
operations, I hope to use these contents as inputs to maximize the inclusiveness of the 
model. I used a standardizer and saved the model parameters 
In order to automate the entire process using scaler in the subsequent pricing analysis.
