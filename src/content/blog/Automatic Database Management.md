The data I selected comes 
from:https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/Pub_ProdResults_Details.jsp?pt=Statistical%20Brief&opt=2&id=1308 
This study analyzed the impact of medical services on pricing. 
I first clarified my research goal to provide clearer pricing logic for healthcare service 
providers. So I chose decision tree and neural network regression.

###

Because healthcare providers have a significant differentiation in service types and 
operations, I hope to use these contents as inputs to maximize the inclusiveness of the 
model. I used a standardizer and saved the model parameters 
In order to automate the entire process using scaler in the subsequent pricing analysis. 

## Methodology:

Decision Tree was employed to identify critical thresholds of service quality indicators (e.g., specialist availability, equipment level), creating rule-based segmentation of healthcare institutions.

K-means Clustering categorized providers into three distinct groups based on operational efficiency metrics derived from service capacity and cost structures.

Neural Network Regression (MLP-based) predicted optimal pricing ranges by learning non-linear relationships between service features, operational clusters, and historical pricing patterns.

### Technical Implementation:

A standardized pipeline integrating MinMaxScaler for feature normalization and model components was containerized for deployment.

The modular system allows providers to input weighted features corresponding to their strategic priorities (e.g., premium services vs cost efficiency), generating customized price suggestions through dynamic model orchestration.

This framework demonstrates how interpretable machine learning techniques can bridge operational analytics with market-responsive pricing strategies in healthcare services.
