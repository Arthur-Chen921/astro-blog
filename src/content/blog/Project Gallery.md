These are some samples of my project or entrepreneurial activities.

In team collaboration, I always play the role of a consultant. Before starting the project, I always clarify the characteristics of each stage and role, and prepare for the worst.

Due to my extensive work experience, I am able to understand the difficulties faced by each department, and I am always able to communicate each other's needs in a way that suits them.Besides,focus on the issue ,not the person.Emphasize achievements accomplished together and focus on common goals， Overcoming difficulties together means more things.

I am good at presenting my ideas rather than just giving data. Sometimes you need to use metaphors and things around the other person to describe your research, and my planning and design work makes these presentations come into play.
