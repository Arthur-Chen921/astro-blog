This is the medical shortage update system I created while conducting data learning.

Standardizing the format of drugs is a challenge, as each drug has a production name,substance name and a generic name, and I have to use code to standardize the format.
I presented the situation of drug shortage on the first page, and it can be seen that nearly 40% of drugs are in short supply, and some drugs have been in short supply for years.

In the second part, I first sorted out the reasons for the shortage of various drugs, and tried to integrate spreadsheets from external databases. I turned my attention to the status of pharmaceutical companies, which are under enormous pressure of research and development costs.I have conducted some surveys on the reduced effectiveness of drug resistance, and I have also noticed that not all drugs are integrated into the input system, and the treatment methods for some chronic diseases directly affect the statistics.
