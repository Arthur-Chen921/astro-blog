This is the medical shortage update system I created while conducting data learning.

I imported data from FDA and cleaned out entries with severe data missing.
Standardizing the format of drugs is a challenge, as each drug has a production name and common name, and I have to use code to standardize the format.
I presented the situation of drug shortage on the first page, and it can be seen that nearly 40% of drugs are in short supply, and some drugs have been in short supply for two years.

In the second part, I first sorted out the reasons for the shortage of various drugs, and tried to integrate forms from external databases. I turned my attention to the operational status of pharmaceutical companies, which are under enormous pressure of research and development costs. I have conducted some surveys on the reduced effectiveness of drug resistance, and I have also noticed that not all drugs are integrated into the input system, and the treatment methods for some chronic diseases directly affect the statistics.
