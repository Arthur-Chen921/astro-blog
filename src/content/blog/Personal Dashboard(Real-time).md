This is a data dashboard project I created while studying finance. Compared to the index provided by large websites, I am more eager to uncover the many details of economic operations.


## Step decomposition

I selected financial indicators on Yahoo, Alpha Vantage, and FMP, and then used Python's data crawling function to classify and reorganize them.
The reports on these websites are always incomplete, indicating that companies have not measured their respective indicators as expected. But we can still see what these companies have done from the ratio of cash flow to changes in their assets.

#### Part1.Data Collection

##### I have selected the top thirty Nasdaq stocks updated in real-time from yfinance. Please note that re running them will update the latest list

```markdown
Import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
# Define the tickers
# I have selected thirty stocks from the Nasdaq component page on March 22nd␣
↪2025
nasdaq_30 = ['OPTN', 'UONEK', 'SCOR', 'AXON', 'STRS', 'CMRX', 'BSBK', 'FNLC',␣
↪'NVCR', 'FNKO',
'NVEC', 'SLAB', 'MSBI', 'AGNC', 'NMRK', 'OPTX', 'IFRX', 'CVCO',␣
↪'TWST', 'STRT',
'SCNI', 'NMRA', 'SDA', 'KLXE', 'JAGX', 'CEAD', 'NVCT', 'STRR',␣
↪'BCG', 'SCNX']
combined_income = pd.DataFrame()
combined_balance = pd.DataFrame()
combined_cashflow = pd.DataFrame()
```
#### Part2.Data Cleaning
> Convert data format
> Handle missing value
> Process the outliers
> Validate

####### Don't forget to validate

```markdown
> In data collection, it is important to standardize the format at the beginning of the collection process and strictly classify the sources of data reporting
> def handle_missing(df, threshold=0.75):
      # Delete high missing rate columns
      missing_ratio = df.isnull().mean()
      cols_to_drop = missing_ratio[missing_ratio > threshold].index.tolist()
      df_cleaned = df.drop(columns=cols_to_drop)
      # Only process numerical columns
      numeric_cols = df_cleaned.select_dtypes(include=np.number).columns.tolist()
      for col in numeric_cols:
          # Step 1: Fill in missing values with the historical mean of the same␣
      ↪company's column
          df_cleaned[col] = df_cleaned.groupby('Ticker')[col].transform(
              lambda x: x.fillna(x.mean())
          )
          # Step 2: If the company has no historical data, fill in the entire␣
      ↪column with the mean
          df_cleaned[col] = df_cleaned[col].fillna(df_cleaned[col].mean())
      return df_cleaned
# Apply
income_clean = handle_missing(income)
balance_clean = handle_missing(balance)
cashflow_clean = handle_missing(cashflow)
def validate_missing(df, name):
    total_missing = df.select_dtypes(include=np.number).isnull().sum().sum()
    print(f"{name}total missing: {total_missing}")

```


#### Part3.Data Visualizaion






##### 

I choose a bar chart to horizontally compare the gross profit and sales management expenses of
different companies. High gross profit but a large proportion of expenses may imply efficiency issues.Many
companies have a high proportion of operating expenses, and the differences in operating
and revenue levels between these companies are often significant. Therefore, directly comparing
their operating amounts may not be a good choice. I chose to analyze their asset and cash flow
composition to determine the operational health of this company.
