**1. Scenario & Conflict Definition**  
**Vertical Scenario**: Supplier Qualification Review in Supply Chain Procurement  
**Typical Conflict Scenarios**:  
1. **Efficiency vs. Compliance Conflict**:  
   - **Procurement Department**: Uses AI to automatically approve low-risk suppliers with complete qualifications to shorten procurement cycles.  
     - *Tech Stack*: Machine learning (historical collaboration data + business registration information scraping) + RPA for automated form filling.  
   - **Legal Department**: Legal AI detects litigation records involving the supplier’s affiliated companies, requiring process suspension.  
     - *Tech Stack*: NLP (real-time monitoring of China Judgments Online) + Knowledge Graph (affiliated company penetration analysis).  
   - **Finance Department**: Identifies that supplier quotes exceed historical average prices in AI models, triggering renegotiation.  
     - *Tech Stack*: Time series forecasting (3-year price fluctuation analysis) + dynamic cost modeling.  

2. **Data Interpretation Conflict**:  
   - **Procurement**: Recommends partnerships based on supplier delivery capability scores.  
   - **Legal**: AI scans contracts and flags ambiguous clauses, demanding manual revision.  
   - **Finance**: Detects conflicts between payment terms and cash flow forecasts, suggesting adjustments to payment timelines.  

**Core Pain Points**:  
- **Goal Conflicts**: Procurement prioritizes efficiency, Legal emphasizes compliance, Finance focuses on cost control.  
- **Decision Silos**: Departmental AI systems operate independently without holistic oversight.  
- **Coordination Challenges**: Manual coordination is time-consuming, with blurred accountability between model decisions and human responsibilities, leading to supplier attrition.

**2. Specific Conflict Scenario (Simplified)**  
**Time**: March 2024  
**Trigger Event**: New supplier "Ruifeng Precision" applies for battery tray supply qualification.  
1. **Procurement Specialist Wang Yue (Efficiency-Oriented)**:  
   - System confirms supplier qualifications (Tax Class A, certifications complete), recommends direct contract signing.  
   - Submits e-contract to Legal/Finance.  
2. **Legal Manager Zhang Tao (Risk-Averse)**:  
   - NLP system identifies unresolved transportation contract disputes involving another company owned by the supplier’s actual controller.  
   - Email alert to Procurement: "Recommend delaying signing; supplementary risk disclosure required."  
3. **Finance Director Chen Min (Cost-Focused)**:  
   - Time series model shows current quote is 12% above 3-year average, exceeding acceptable fluctuation (±5%).  
   - Internal system flag: "Recommend renegotiation to avoid missing quarterly cost-saving targets."

**3. Solution Design**  
**"ChainAI Judge" Cross-Departmental AI Arbitration Workflow**  
A three-phase governance method transforms AI conflicts into traceable organizational decisions, managing technical complexity through predefined rules.  

**Phase 1: Conflict Identification & Classification (Automated)**  
- **System**: Supply Chain Governance AI Tagging System  
- **Inputs**:  
  - Daily: Summaries of departmental AI standards and tool documentation.  
  - Emergency: Legal AI risk ratings + Finance AI cost deviation reports + Procurement AI supplier metrics.  
- **Workflow**:  
  1. Activate **Pre-Processing Matrix**:  
     | Conflict Type            | Resolution Channel          | Time Limit |  
     |--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|  
     | Single metric outrate        | Auto-compensation negotiation | 2h         |  
     | Dual-goal conflict       | Departmental pre-review     | 8h         |  
     | Triple conflict + Confidence difference | Escalate to AI Arbitration  | 24h        |  
  2. Generate **Conflict Summary Report** highlighting departmental outputs.  
  3. Prepare for Phase 2: Decision Arbitration.

**Phase 2: Decision Arbitration (Human-AI Collaboration)**  
- **Executor**: Cross-Departmental AI Arbitration Committee  
- **Participants**:  
  - Chair: Supply Chain Director  
  - Members: Deputy heads of Procurement, Legal, Finance + Internal Audit.  
- **Process**:  
  1. **Preparation (Automated)**:  
     - Extract historical case resolutions tagged with governance responsibility types.  
     - Generate impact prediction dashboard (supplier attrition probability/compliance risk score/cost fluctuation range).  
  2. **Output**:  
     - Conditional execution instructions (e.g., "Approve but increase performance bond").  
     - Update training data labels for all three AIs.

**Phase 3: Execution & Feedback (Closed-Loop Control)**  
- **Responsibility Matrix**:  
  | Task                  | Owner     | Supervisor       | Success Criteria                  |  
  |-----------------------|-----------|------------------|------------------------------------|  
  | Contract revision     | Legal     | Internal Audit   | Risk score < threshold            |  
  | Payment adjustment    | Finance   | Arbitration AI   | Cash flow deviation <5%           |  
  | Supplier relationship | Procurement | Customer Success + AI Committee | Satisfaction score maintained |  
- **Control Points**:  
  - **Traceability**: Unique event IDs linked to supplier profiles.  
  - **Quarterly Review**: Analyze AI误判 patterns to optimize models.  
  - **Cost Quantification**: Convert hidden compliance costs (e.g., legal due diligence hours) into decision parameters to prevent KPI-driven cost shifting.

**4. Why It Solves the Problem?**  
1. **Goal Conflicts → Arbitrable Issues**:  
   - *Conflict Classification Matrix* converts abstract conflicts into actionable types (e.g., "efficiency vs. compliance" triggers dual-goal resolution).  
2. **Decision Silos → Unified Baseline**:  
   - Arbitration mandates transparent AI decision logic (e.g., Legal AI must cite specific laws).  
   - Shared impact prediction models eliminate departmental data biases.  
3. **Coordination Inefficiency → Standardized Response**:  
   - Reduces resolution time from 2-3 days (manual) to ≤24h (automated).  
   - Builds a **Conflict Resolution Knowledge Base** to accelerate future decisions.

**5. Implementation Case: "Ruifeng Precision" Resolution & Outcome**  
**Phase 1: Conflict Identification (Initiated within 24h)**  
- Trigger: Triple conflict (Procurement AI approval + Legal AI freeze + Finance AI renegotiation) activates 24h arbitration.  

**Phase 2: Arbitration (Human-AI Collaboration)**  
- **Committee Actions**:  
  - Reviewed historical cases (similar litigation + premium suppliers).  
  - System predictions: 68% attrition probability vs. 0.62 compliance risk score.  
- **Resolution**:  
  - Contract: Added "affiliated litigation disclosure" clause.  
  - Payment: Reduced upfront payment from 50% to 40%, final payment tied to litigation outcome.  
  - AI Training: Legal AI no longer auto-freezes运输 disputes but triggers payment reviews.  

**Phase 3: Execution & Feedback (30-Day Closure)**  
- **Results**:  
  | Task                  | Outcome                              |  
  |-----------------------|--------------------------------------|  
  | Contract revision     | Risk score reduced to 0.58 (reach the standard)     |  
  | Payment adjustment    | Cost deviation at 4.9% (<5%)         |  
  | Supplier relationship | Satisfaction score maintained at 82  |  

**Phase 4: AI Governance Upgrade**  
- Legal AI: Reduced risk weighting for affiliates with <20% ownership.  
- Finance AI: Added "emergency procurement premium" exemption.  
- Added 1 case to the **Cross-Departmental Collaboration Library**.
